## HASOC Competition Code

### Current Dataset
> English and German

Extract the datasets into two folders: **english_dataset** and **german_dataset**.
Code is run for english dataset for all three tasks.

### Among statistical machine learning methods, we have basic Naive-Bayes, SVM and Random Forest algorithms. Advanced models are yet to be included

1. Run the preprocessing.py file first to create pickle files required by the statistical models
2. Run naive-bayes.py/svm.py/rf.py

### Among deep neural network methods, we have basic CNN. Advanced models are yet to be included

1. Run the dnn-preprocess.py file first to create pickle files required by the CNN model. Pickle files are created inside a folder called _pickle_files_
2. Run cnn.py to run the CNN model
